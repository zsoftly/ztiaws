**Release Date:** October 12, 2025

## Overview

This release introduces a major user experience enhancement by integrating an interactive fuzzy finder into core SSM commands. Finding and selecting EC2 instances is now faster, easier, and less error-prone.

## Key Features

### Interactive Fuzzy Finder for SSM Commands

- **A Faster, More Intuitive Workflow**: Say goodbye to manually copying and pasting instance IDs. The `ssm` commands below now launch an interactive fuzzy finder when an instance ID is not provided:
    - `ztictl ssm connect`
    - `ztictl ssm list`
    - `ztictl ssm exec`
    - `ztictl ssm transfer`
    - `ztictl ssm start | stop | reboot`

- **Find Instances Instantly**: Simply type a few characters of an instance's name, ID, or tag to instantly filter through the list in real-time.

- **Enhanced Stability**: The fuzzy finder is built to be robust. It gracefully handles unexpected user input and terminal resizing, preventing crashes and ensuring a smooth experience.

## Other Changes

- No other user-facing changes in this release.
