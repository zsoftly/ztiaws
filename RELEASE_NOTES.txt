# ztictl v2.7.0 Release Notes

**Installation:** [Installation Guide](https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws/blob/release/v2.7.0/INSTALLATION.md)

**Release Date:** September 10, 2025

## Overview

ztictl is a unified AWS SSM management tool that provides both Go binary and bash script implementations. The Go version (`ztictl`) is the primary implementation with enhanced features, while the bash scripts (`authaws`, `ssm`) are maintained for backward compatibility only.

**Note:** The bash scripts are no longer receiving new features or updates. All development efforts are focused on the Go implementation.

## üéØ Key Features in v2.7.0

### 1. **Multi-Region Command Execution** üåç
Execute commands across multiple AWS regions simultaneously with the new `ssm exec-multi` command:
```bash
ztictl ssm exec-multi --regions us-east-1,eu-west-1 --command "df -h"
```
- Parallel execution across regions for faster results
- Aggregated output with clear region identification
- Support for all standard SSM exec options

### 2. **Shell Completion Support** üöÄ
Full bash and zsh completion for all ztictl commands:
```bash
# Install completion for bash
ztictl completion bash

```
- Tab completion for commands, flags, and arguments
- Automatic instance ID completion
- System-wide or user-specific installation options

### 3. **Simplified SSO Configuration** ‚öôÔ∏è

- Interactive configuration wizard with validation

### 4. **Enhanced Documentation** üìö
