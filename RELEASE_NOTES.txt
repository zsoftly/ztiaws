# ztictl v2.7.0 Release Notes

**Installation:** [Installation Guide](https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws/blob/release/v2.7.0/INSTALLATION.md)

**Release Date:** September 10, 2025

## Overview

ztictl is a unified AWS SSM management tool that provides both Go binary and bash script implementations. The Go version (`ztictl`) is the primary implementation with enhanced features, while the bash scripts (`authaws`, `ssm`) are maintained for backward compatibility only.

**Note:** The bash scripts are no longer receiving new features or updates. All development efforts are focused on the Go implementation.

## New Features
* feat: auto-update version in Makefile and root.go during release
* Enhance bash completion installation logic: add support for system path installation with sudo, improve path validation, and update test cases for mocked sudo behavior.
* Add AWS credential handling to tests: disable EC2 IMDS to prevent timeouts and CI/CD failures
* Enhance test setup and maintenance guidelines
* Enhance AWS SSO configuration: simplify domain ID input, set default region to ca-central-1, and improve URL construction logic. Add tests for domain ID extraction and configuration validation.
* Add comprehensive documentation for ztictl commands, configuration, and multi-region operations
* Implement comprehensive AWS region validation and refactor related tests
* Add multi-region command execution tests and region configuration setup

## Bug Fixes
