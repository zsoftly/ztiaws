  ssm use1 i-1234                      # Connect to instance in US East
  ssm i-1234                           # Connect to instance in Canada Central
  ssm exec cac1 i-1234 "systemctl status nginx"   # Run command on instance
  ssm exec cac1 web-server-prod "systemctl status nginx"  # Run command using instance name
  ssm exec-tagged use1 Role web "df -h" # Run command on instances with tag Role=web
  ssm upload cac1 i-1234 ./config.txt /etc/app/config.txt    # Upload file
  ssm download cac1 i-1234 /var/log/app.log ./app.log        # Download file

File Transfer Notes:
  - Files < 1MB: Direct transfer via SSM (faster)
  - Files â‰¥ 1MB: Transfer via S3 intermediary (reliable for large files)
  - S3 bucket is auto-created and files are auto-deleted after 24 hours
  - Instance must have AWS CLI installed and proper IAM permissions for S3 access (large files only)
  ssm logs cac1 i-1234                        # View recent logs for instance
  ssm logs use1 /aws/lambda/my-function       # View logs from specific log group
  ssm logs cac1 /var/log/messages "ERROR"     # Filter logs for ERROR messages

CloudWatch Logs Notes:
  - Shows logs from the last hour by default
  - Instance logs require CloudWatch agent to be installed and configured
  - Requires proper IAM permissions for CloudWatch Logs access
