## 1. Introduction   

ZTiAWS was built to make AWS management **faster, safer, and simpler.**  
It reduces the friction of using the AWS CLI by abstracting complex commands into clear, human-friendly operations.

**Example:**  

```bash
# Traditional AWS CLI
aws ssm start-session --target i-1234567890abcdef0

# With ZTiAWS
ztictl ssm connect i-1234567890abcdef0
```


Key Features

- Cross-platform:                Native binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows (AMD64/ARM64)
- Interactive fuzzy finder:      Real-time instance selection with keyboard navigation
- Secure AWS SSO authentication: Built-in session caching for streamlined logins
- Smart operations:              OS detection and automatic command adaptation
- S3-backed file transfers:      Integrated lifecycle management for uploads and downloads
- Tag-based automation:          Multi-instance and multi-region control through AWS tags
- Professional logging:          Thread-safe, structured, and easily filterable logs
- Modern CLI:                    Clean flag-based syntax with built-in validation and help support



## 2. Installation & Setup

Linux / macOS

```bash
curl -L -o /tmp/ztictl \
"https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws/releases/latest/download/ztictl-$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/; s/aarch64/arm64/')" \
&& chmod +x /tmp/ztictl && sudo mv /tmp/ztictl /usr/local/bin/ztictl && ztictl --version
```

Windows (PowerShell)
```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws/releases/latest/download/ztictl-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\ztictl.exe"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\Tools" | Out-Null
Move-Item "$env:TEMP\ztictl.exe" "$env:USERPROFILE\Tools\ztictl.exe"
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "$env:PATH;$env:USERPROFILE\Tools", "User")
ztictl --version
```

 “Installation is one command across all platforms — no dependency hell, no setup pain.”




## 3. Configuration & Authentication

### Step 1 — Initialize Configuration

```bash
ztictl config init --interactive
ztictl config check --fix
```

### Step 2 — Authenticate via AWS SSO
ztictl auth login

✅ Automatically:

Checks required components (AWS CLI, SSM plugin)
Prompts for SSO login with interactive account/role selection
Stores temporary credentials securely

 “Unlike the AWS CLI, ZTiAWS provides a guided SSO flow that securely manages temporary credentials and IAM role selection.”


## 4. Use Cases — Demonstration Scenarios

### Use Case 1: List and Connect to EC2 Instances

```bash
ztictl ssm list --region ca-central-1
ztictl ssm connect --region ca-central-1
```

Highlights:
Interactive fuzzy finder for instance selection
Auto-detects OS (Linux vs Windows)

Benefit:
Fast, secure access with zero SSH key management.


### Use Case 2: Execute Cross-Platform Commands
### Linux Instance
```bash
ztictl ssm exec ca-central-1 i-linux123 "uname -a"
```
### Windows Instance
``` bash
ztictl ssm exec ca-central-1 i-windows456 "Get-ComputerInfo"
```

Benefit:
Runs OS-specific commands automatically using Bash or PowerShell — no manual detection needed.


### Use Case 3: Multi-Region and Tag-Based Operations
```bash
ztictl ssm exec-tagged us-east-1 --tags Environment=prod,Role=web "df -h"
ztictl ssm exec-multi ca-central-1,us-east-1,eu-west-1 --tags "App=web" "uptime"
```

Benefit:
Execute parallel commands across multiple regions and tagged instances with a single command.


### Use Case 4: Smart File Transfers

### Upload to remote instance
```bash
ztictl ssm transfer upload i-linux123 ./config.txt /etc/app/config.txt
```

### Download logs
```bash
ztictl ssm transfer download i-windows456 C:\logs\sys.log ./sys.log
```

Benefit:
Automatic S3 routing for large files with secure lifecycle cleanup.


### Use Case 5: Instance Power Management
```bash
ztictl ssm start-tagged --tags "AutoStart=true" --region euw1
ztictl ssm stop-tagged --tags "Environment=dev" --region cac1
```

Benefit:
Start or stop multiple EC2 instances by tag or environment from a single terminal command.
