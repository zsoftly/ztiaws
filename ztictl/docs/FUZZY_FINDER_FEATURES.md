# Fuzzy Finder Features

The `ztictl` fuzzy finder provides interactive selection across multiple commands, including modern text editing and mouse support capabilities.

## Available in Commands

### Authentication
- **`ztictl auth login`** - Interactive account/role selection

### SSM Instance Operations (v2.1+)
All SSM commands support interactive instance selection by omitting the instance identifier:

- **`ztictl ssm connect [--region <region>]`** - Connect to an instance
- **`ztictl ssm list [--region <region>]`** - List and select instances
- **`ztictl ssm exec [--region <region>] "<command>"`** - Execute commands on an instance
- **`ztictl ssm transfer upload [--region <region>] <local> <remote>`** - Upload files to an instance
- **`ztictl ssm transfer download [--region <region>] <remote> <local>`** - Download files from an instance
- **`ztictl ssm start [--region <region>]`** - Start a stopped instance
- **`ztictl ssm stop [--region <region>]`** - Stop a running instance
- **`ztictl ssm reboot [--region <region>]`** - Reboot a running instance

### Usage Example
```bash
# Traditional way (still supported)
ztictl ssm connect i-1234567890abcdef0 --region cac1

# Interactive way (launches fuzzy finder)
ztictl ssm connect --region cac1
```

## Instance State Validation

When using the fuzzy finder for SSM operations, `ztictl` automatically validates instance states to prevent invalid operations:

### Validation Rules

| Operation | Required Instance State | Requires SSM Agent Online |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| `connect` | `running` | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `exec` | `running` | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `transfer` | `running` | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `start` | `stopped` | ‚ùå No |
| `stop` | `running` | ‚ùå No |
| `reboot` | `running` | ‚ùå No |

### Error Feedback

If an instance is in an invalid state, you'll receive clear feedback:

```
‚úó Cannot start - Instance is not in required state

Instance Details:
  Instance ID: i-1234567890abcdef0
  Name:        web-server-prod
  State:       ‚óè running
  Required:    [stopped]

üí° Tip: Instance is already running. Use 'reboot' to restart it:
   ztictl ssm reboot i-1234567890abcdef0 --region ca-central-1
```

### Instance State Reference

- **‚óè running** - Instance is running and operational (green)
- **‚óã stopped** - Instance is stopped (red)
- **‚óë stopping** - Instance is in the process of stopping (yellow)
- **‚óê pending** - Instance is starting up (yellow)
- **‚úó terminated** - Instance has been permanently deleted (red)
- **‚óë shutting-down** - Instance is shutting down, will be terminated (yellow)

## Visual Feedback

- **Selected text** is highlighted with inverted colors for visibility
- **Preview window** shows detailed information about the currently highlighted item
- **Border** surrounds the finder for clear visual boundaries
- **Responsive height** adapts to terminal size (configurable via `ZTICTL_SELECTOR_HEIGHT`)
- **Truly dynamic width** that is content-driven and terminal-aware:
  - Minimum width: 80 columns for comfortable readability.
  - No arbitrary maximum width; it uses the terminal width as a natural limit.
  - Automatically expands to fit the longest account/role name, preventing truncation.
  - Intelligently considers all UI elements (prompt, borders, preview window) in its width calculation.
- **Left-aligned positioning** anchored at bottom-left corner of terminal
  - Extends rightward as content requires
  - Doesn't take over full terminal width unnecessarily
  - Leaves right side of terminal visible for context

## Tips

1. **Fast searching**: Start typing immediately to filter results - no need to click into the search box
2. **Copy account IDs**: Select text with mouse drag, then Ctrl+C to copy account IDs or role names
3. **Paste searches**: Use Ctrl+V to paste account IDs or search terms from clipboard
4. **Quick navigation**: Use Page Up/Down to quickly browse long lists of accounts or roles
5. **Mouse shortcuts**: Right-click to paste is often faster than Ctrl+V

## Error Handling

The fuzzy finder includes panic recovery to handle unexpected errors gracefully. If an unexpected error occurs:

```
‚ùå An unexpected error occurred in the account selector.
   Please report this issue at: https://github.com/zsoftly/ztiaws/issues
   Error details: [error message]
```

The application will exit cleanly with code 1 instead of crashing with a stack trace.

## Environment Variables

- **ZTICTL_SELECTOR_HEIGHT** - Number of items to display (default: 5, range: 1-20)
  ```bash
  export ZTICTL_SELECTOR_HEIGHT=10  # Show 10 items instead of 5
  ```
